OOConfGeneration.h
By Jens Ayton

OOConf seraliziation of property list types, more or less. (Supported classes:
NSDictionary, NSArray, NSString, NSNumber, NSNull. Not NSDate or NSData.)

OOConf format is similar to JSON, but with the following changes:
* OOConf files must be encoded in UTF-8. A BOM (the byte sequence
  0xEF,0xBB,0xBF at the beginning of the file) is permitted, but not
  recommended.
* Object keys which are ASCII identifiers do not require quotation marks.
  Specifically, unquoted keys are permitted if they match:
  /\b[a-zA-Z\$_][a-zA-Z\$_0-9]*\b/
* JavaScript-style comments (both types) are allowed. Note that JavaScript,
  and hence OOConf, does not share the C++/C99 misfeature that a backslash at
  the end of a single-line comment wraps it to the next line.

The following relationships hold:
* Every valid OOConf file is a valid JavaScript file that does nothing.
* Every valid JSON file in UTF-8 is a valid OOConf file.
* Every OOConf file that does not use unquoted object keys or comments is a
  valid JSON file.

Many similar JSON-like formats exist, but I haven't found one that adds the
desired features without also adding other extensions, hence the need for a
new name.
