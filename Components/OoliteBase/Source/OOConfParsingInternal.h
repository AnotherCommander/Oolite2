/*	OOConfParser has specialized delegate behaviour.
	The delegate is expected to remain the same object throughout parsing.
	However, different delegate actions may be called in different contexts.
	When a delegate action is called, it must either call
	-parseWithDelegateAction: recursively, consume the next object in the token
	stream in some other way, or return NO to indicate failure. (A failing
	action should also report an error to the problem report manager.) A NULL
	action may be passed to -parseWithDelegateAction in order to skip over an
	object.
	
	The signature for delegate actions is:
	- (BOOL) handleElement:(void *)key isArray:(BOOL)isArray producingObject:(id *)outObject;
	
	If isArray is true, key is an NSUInteger (not an NSNumber *!). If isArray
	is false, we're dealing with a dictionary and key is an NSString *.
