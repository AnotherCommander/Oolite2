	Like +stringWithContentsOfFile:, but biased towards Unicode encodings and
	cross-system consistency. Specifically:
	* If the file starts with a UTF-16 BOM, assume UTF-16.
	* Otherwise, if the file can be interpreted as UTF-8, assume UTF-8.
	* Otherwise, assume ISO-Latin-1.

	UTF-16 code elements.

	Add escape codes for string so that it's a valid JavaScript literal (if
	you put double quotes around it). Also valid for GraphViz and JSON.
	
	IMPORTANT: in order to be compatible with JSON, this does not encode ' as
	\', so the resulting string *must* be quoted with double quotes.
